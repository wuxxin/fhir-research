  Well folks, we had to do it (again). We’ve spent a decade filming America’s national parks, and after countless requests from viewers, we finally sat down, put our heads together, and created this comprehensive list of US national parks ranked from best to worst. This update includes our latest 2025 rankings – there were some big moves.

  Now mind you, this was no easy task ranking the best national parks in the USA – America has 63 national parks (and counting)!

  Our method? We decided to be brutally honest about the reality of each and every national park (you might be surprised to see where we ranked some very famous national parks) because nothing is worse than feeling misled by jaw-dropping photos void of crowds, right?

  We’ve also ranked all 128 US National Monuments in case you’re interested in those as well.

  How We Ranked the Best National Parks

  – Click for the details on how we ranked the best parks! More Than Just Parks Co-Founders Jim & Will Pattiz at Badlands National Park The Experts Behind This Ranked National Parks List We’re Jim Pattiz and Will Pattiz, collectively known as the Pattiz Brothers (and sometimes the Parks Brothers) and we absolutely LOVE the national parks. You should probably know that we didn’t just make this list of the best national parks up out of thin air. We’ve spent our entire adult lives exploring and filming America’s national parks and public lands. We’ve worked with the National Park Service, the Department of Interior, USDA, and the U.S. Forest Service for years creating films on important places and issues. Our work has been featured in leading publications all over the world and even some people outside of our immediate family call us experts on the national parks. National Parks Ranking Criteria Now, you might ask how on earth we ranked America’s national parks from best to worst. We ranked all of the national parks based on a variety of factors including accessibility, crowd sizes, recreational opportunities, park amenities, and of course, scenic beauty. You should also know that this list only covers the 63 congressional designated National Parks. Not National Grasslands, National Forests, National Historical Parks, National Monuments, Wilderness, etc. This year’s rankings saw a lot of volatility. Some parks moved as much as 21 places from our previous scores. Given that the parks don’t change all that much you’re probably wondering how that could be. I don’t blame you. The reason is because we changed our formula this year to better rank the parks. When we first released this list, each of the following criteria were weighted equally to comprise our 50 point ranking scale. This year we updated the list to weight certain categories more than others (see below). While this ranking system may not be perfect (I mean what is anyway), we’re always working to improve it so feel free to leave us a comment at the bottom of the post with suggestions. Scenery (14pts) – The scenic beauty of the park. Purely subjective of course, but for most folks (including us) this is the single most important factor. Accessibility (8pts) – Is this national park easy to access? Not only getting to the park but getting to places within the park. We analyzed vehicle access, transportation options, proximity to major airports, lodging and accommodations, conveniences, roads within the park, ADA accessibility, along with other signs of infrastructure and civilization. Recreation (10pts) – Recreation opportunities found within the park like hiking, biking, boating, climbing, etc. Crowds (10pts) – How crowded is this national park? We considered visitation, traffic, crowded overlooks & trails, limited campsite availability, lines, etc. Amenities (8pts) – Developed amenities within the park like visitors centers, campgrounds, bathrooms, lodges, dining, etc.

  NOTE: If you feel like there’s a better way to rank the parks or that any of these parks scores should be re-evaluated, please drop us a comment below. These are living rankings that are adjusted accordingly when we receive compelling arguments.

  Ranking Olympic National Park as the best national park in America again? Yep. As much fun as it would have been to crown a new top park, it just wouldn’t have been right. This absolutely majestic national park deserves its GOAT status.

  Olympic National Park is the most diverse national park in America, hands down. It’s like four parks in one. Olympic has everything from lowland forests, striking mountain ranges, pristine alpine lakes, sparkling rivers, temperate rain forests (the largest in the lower 48), iconic wildlife, and over 50 miles of wild coastline!

  Oh, and it’s a stones throw from Seattle! Olympic National Park truly has it all and while the crowds have been on the rise in recent years, they’re still far from the hoards that have become so insidious in other US national parks. It’s for these reasons that this Pacific Northwest gem is still the best national park in America.

  John Muir described Mount Rainier best,“The most luxuriant and the most extravagantly beautiful of all the alpine gardens I ever beheld in all my mountain-top wanderings”.

  With our updated formula, this year Mount Rainier moved up to number two on our list. And those who have visited will find it tough to dispute the ranking. This most heavily glaciated peak in the contiguous US is downright mesmerizing. Similar to the feeling one gets when looking into the Grand Canyon, you can gaze upon this mountain for hours without fathoming what exactly you’re looking at.

  Mount Rainier has so much more to offer than the magnificently glaciated mountain surrounded by carpets of the most beautiful wildflowers you’ve ever seen. It has vast old growth forests, clear blue rivers, abundant wildlife, countless vistas, and some of the best hiking opportunities in America.

  Summer crowds can be troublesome and wildfires seem to be more present with each passing year, but plan accordingly and you’ll be amazed by this immensely beautiful national park. It should be noted that Rainier is one of the growing list of national parks that require reservations.

  Dropping this national park down to the third best national park might come as a bit of a surprise, but number three is still pretty great. Grand Teton National Park is truly iconic and, thanks to strong management and foresight, has been able to avoid the overcrowding more characteristic of its neighbor to the north, Yellowstone.

  Here you’ll find the spectacular Teton mountains, the winding Snake River, gorgeous lakes and valleys, and some of the best wildlife viewing opportunities in the entire national park system.

  The reason Grand Teton comes in behind its Pacific Northwest contemporaries comes down to accessibility. The closest major city/airport is Salt Lake City at 4.5 hours driving. Bozeman is a touch closer at four hours but flights and rental cars are less available and more expensive.

  As the largest park in the contiguous United States at over 1.6 million acres, Death Valley embodies every aspect of an epic US national park. Star Wars landscapes fill the mind with wonder as superlatives are the name of the game here. Death Valley features the lowest point in North America, has the hottest ever recorded air temperature on the planet, the tallest sand dunes in North America, and the driest place in the United States.

  Despite the morbid name Death Valley has an abundance of life and incredible sights. So long as you don’t visit during the summer when temperatures can soar into the 130s you’re bound to have a great time here.

  Death Valley moved up nine spots in our updated rankings this year, from thirteen all the way up to four. The combination of easy accessibility from Las Vegas, unbounded recreation (only thing is missing was water – enter Lake Manly), lack of overcrowding issues, and a diversity of otherworldly scenery all contributed to this huge move. And honestly, I think Death Valley still has room to run in future rankings.

  Glacier National Park is one of the grandfathers of the National Park Service and continues to stand the test of time as one of the best national parks in the US. This exceedingly beautiful mountainous park and its jaw-dropping vistas make other park overlooks seem tame by comparison. If you can make the drive from the nearest major airport or city, (which aren’t exactly close), Glacier provides ample recreation opportunities and a park experience that people of all abilities can enjoy.

  Among the musts in this park is driving the spectacular Going-to-the-Sun Road, a true engineering marvel that winds through the mountains providing unparalleled views of one of the best national parks in America.

  This year Glacier moved up one spot to crack into the top five best national parks. The increased weight to scenery was the major factor here. While it gets very high marks for amenities we’d love to see increased camping bandwidth.

  There was a time when Yosemite National Park likely would’ve been #1 on our list of best National Parks in the US. But alas, it’s the 21st century and John Muir’s “grandest of all temples of nature” is bursting at the seams with tourists in search of their latest social media trophy (hiking Half Dome is a mess).

  But at the end of the day it’s still Yosemite National Park. Once there you’ll realize just why the park is one of the most popular in the US. Despite the summer crowds, the valley and the park are truly one of the natural wonders of the world.

  Yosemite is a true marvel and one of the most spectacular places on earth. Here you’ll find the epic grandeur of Yosemite Valley, the ancient wonders of the Mariposa Grove, and towering waterfalls like Yosemite Falls. The immense beauty found here is overwhelming and has a tendency to make one feel small in the most humbling way. We strongly recommend visiting in the off-season (May & October) for the best experience.

  Sure we could try to describe to you the singular beauty and majesty of one of the great wonders of the world or we could let one of America’s greatest presidents do it.

  In the Grand Canyon, Arizona has a natural wonder which is in kind absolutely unparalleled throughout the rest of the world. I want to ask you to keep this great wonder of nature as it now is. I hope you will not have a building of any kind, not a summer cottage, a hotel or anything else, to mar the wonderful grandeur, the sublimity, the great loneliness and beauty of the canyon. Leave it as it is. You cannot improve on it. The ages have been at work on it, and man can only mar it. Theodore Roosevelt

  With our latest formula Grand Canyon moved up four spots to #7 this year. This was largely due to a more heavily weighted scenery score for which the Grand Canyon received grand remarks, a full 14 points. It doesn’t get more jaw-dropping than this.

  Yes the South Rim of the Grand Canyon sees crowds in the summer that are reminiscent of a Disney World parking lot, but Grand Canyon is a large national park. You might be surprised to learn that there are many areas in the park with the same jaw-dropping views that won’t make you feel like you’re in the busiest terminal of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on Christmas Eve.

  The beauty of the ancient Sequoia trees found in Sequoia National Park defy any attempt to describe them as John Muir so aptly wrote, “The Big Tree is Nature’s forest masterpiece, and, so far as I know, the greatest of living things. No description can give any adequate idea of their singular majesty, much less their beauty. “

  Here, amongst groves of the largest trees in the world, one can’t possibly avoid being humbled and awed by the power of nature. In addition to its namesake trees, the park has abundant amenities and outside of peak summer crowding isn’t too bad. We highly recommend adding this national park to your list as it is one of the best in the world.

  Do behold the King in his glory, King Sequoia! Behold! Behold! seems all I can say.

  Some time ago I left all for Sequoia and have been and am at his feet, fasting and praying for light, for is he not the greatest light in the woods, in the world?” John Muir

  One of the best national parks in America and the crown jewel of the eastern U.S. parks, Great Smoky Mountains National Park protects a vast swath of the immense beauty of the Appalachian Mountains.

  These old mountains, forests, and streams have a character about them that tends to invite one to slow down and imagine a world where this was what much of the eastern United States looked like. Herds of elk freely roam the park and bears, otters, deer, foxes, and woodpeckers are commonly sighted.

  The Most Visited National Park in America

  Though Great Smoky Mountains is the most-visited national park in the United States, it’s important to note that some of this “visitation” is due to the park having no entrance fees or stations and being home to a highway that serves as a busy commuter corridor.

  In reality, apart from the summer and any time in the Cades Cove area – which can see serious crowding, the park is actually not terribly crowded and it can be quite easy to find yourself on a trail with no one around – if you know where to go. Great Smoky Mountains National Park is flush with amenities like visitors centers and campgrounds and, thanks to the nearby towns of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, has plenty of food and lodging opportunities.

  Denali moved up nine places in our updated rankings, leaping into our top ten. It’s deserved. This grandest Alaska national park has some of the most breathtaking scenery in the world, very limited crowds, and endless recreation opportunities (for those exceedingly adventurous souls).

  Denali also happens to be one of the most accessible Alaskan national parks with limited driving access, bus access that gets you further, visitor center, campgrounds, and the famous car lottery.

The tallest trees in the world soar to unimaginable heights all around you and command your awed gaze. Yes, here in Redwood National Park you’ll be forgiven if you start to think you’re another planet, like say Endor…

  So why did Redwood move down six spots in this year’s rankings? It’s more a case of Redwood staying put while others moved past it. Personally I love this place and greedily and glad to see it out of the top ten. More of the park for you and me.

Here, in the pristine waters of vast lakes and the mosaic of islands and boreal forest that comprise the park, you can truly get away from it all and listen to nothing but the sound of your canoe gliding in the tranquil water and the distant calls of loons.

  From kaleidoscopic sunrises and sunsets mirrored on the glassy waters of its lakes, to some of the most spectacular displays of the northern lights you’ll find anywhere on earth, Voyageurs is a true monument to the wonders of nature.

  We were sad to see Voyageurs drop out of the top ten this year but number twelve on this list is nothing to be ashamed of.

  The Most Underrated National Park in America

  It’s no secret that we’re big fans of this supremely underrated national park in Minnesota’s far north. There is so much to see and do in Voyageurs and you can truly feel like you have the place to yourself. In the summer you can spend seemingly endless days on the water, fishing, exploring, and stopping and hiking island bluffs or just relaxing on the beach. In the fall the shorelines and islands are ablaze with reds, yellows, and oranges, and the waters are calm and quiet.

  Winter brings a deep freeze to this coldest part of the continental U.S. and with it a whole new array of activities, like snowmobiling, ice fishing, cross-country-skiing, and even dog-sledding. The only drawback to Voyageurs is its remoteness and the fact that the park is exclusively accessible by water, meaning you’ll have to rent a canoe, kayak, or motorboat to get around. Obviously it’s a catch-22, because that’s also what makes this national park so special.

  Ah, Yellowstone National Park, the national park that started it all. Seeing the original national park rank outside of our list of the top 10 national parks in America is sure to raise some eyebrows, but hear us out.

  Yellowstone is an absolutely spectacular and magical national park. A landscape dotted with otherworldly thermal works, bison holdouts from a time when they ruled the prairie, a thriving wolf population, and an encapsulation of the great American west.

  What’s not to love, you ask?

  Quite frankly, the crowds. I mean sure, we get it. When you’re managing a place that swells with millions of eager tourists annually, you’re bound to come across challenges managing the influx. But today, Yellowstone is the Disneyland of national parks complete with food courts, souvenir shops, resort villages, and more.

  Street traffic (and we’re not talking “bison jams”) due to the sheer amount of cars entering the park has become a real issue here. As a result, and despite its stunning beauty, we’ve dropped it to number 13 on our list of the best national parks in America ranked.

  Tucked into the heart of Colorado’s Front Range, Rocky Mountain National Park spans more than 400 square miles of breathtaking mountain scenery and ranks in our top 10 best national parks in the US. This national park is considered by many to be the crown jewel of the American Rockies and it’s no wonder why. Rocky Mountain is home to an incredible diversity of wildlife including elk, moose, bighorn sheep, beaver, deer, black bear, eagles, marmots, mountain lions, and so much more.

  Rocky Mountain National Park Video | America’s National Parks Ranked

  And the catch…

  However, in recent years visitation has increased dramatically at the expense of the visitor experience (not to mention the impact on the park itself). What was once mostly an issue reserved for the bear lake area of the park has spread to the rest of the park (especially around the Estes Park entrance).

  Crowd sizes have swelled to the point that the National Park Service has instituted a timed entry program. With population centers soaring near the park, we expect this issue to become more exacerbated with each passing year. Were it not for everyone else loving the park as much as you and I, this would easily be a top five national park.

  Imagine the Sahara Desert with a backdrop of the Rocky Mountains – you’re looking at one of the most underrated national parks in America, Great Sand Dunes National Park. Great Sand Dunes is a spectacular park located in southern Colorado that features some of the most breathtaking and unique scenery anywhere in the world.

  Great Sand Dunes is home to the tallest dunes in North America rising to over 300 feet tall, sandboarding, seasonal creeks to splash around in with the kids, along with loads of Alpine beauty including pristine lakes for fishing.

  The tough part is getting to the park because it’s fairly remote and doesn’t easily make its way into a national park road trip. The good news is that when you arrive crowds will be minimal.

  FYI bugs can be a bit of an issue in the Spring so plan accordingly.

  The last time we made this list we were sure North Cascades would be moving up in the future – it’s nice not to be wrong. Referred to by some as the “American Alps” with mountain beauty that rivals any range on the planet, North Cascades is the crown jewel of the mighty cascade range. One of three Washington national parks, North Cascades is the least visited, the most difficult to access all around, and perhaps the most rewarding for those who dare.

  This is a backpackers paradise to be sure, but it’s just not very approachable for the average national park/outdoors enthusiast. All the best North Cascades trails are long and feature lots of incline (they’re also unbelievably beautiful). For that reason we had to dock it on accessibility. We also docked it for amenities of which there are few.

  That said, the park’s interior is absolutely stunningly beautiful as a simple Google image search will show you, and its lack of crowds and backcountry offerings are a major plus. If you’re interested in getting off the beaten path and seeing some amazing scenery, here’s your chance.

Thermal works here in an area known as Bumpass Hell rival some of those you can find in Yellowstone. Throw in some stunning alpine lakes, sugar pine forests, and purple mountain majesty and you’ve got a general feeling for the place. The catch here is distance from a major airport or conveniences.

  Lassen moved up a whopping sixteen places with our new formula bounding into the top twenty. It deserves to be here. Anyone who’s visited (when the thermal areas are open) will tell you that this place is truly special. As for the negatives, it’s a bit out there. Wildfires and crowding in the summer are also growing issues.

  Cue the furious Zion fans. Listen folks, we love Zion, but the truth is this park is an absolute mess right now. We hear a lot today about our national parks being “loved to death” and no park epitomizes this problem more than Zion (think Angels Landing & The Narrows).

  While the park is jaw-droppingly beautiful and home to world-class recreational opportunities, it’s also completely choked with tourists on every trail and crowding every vista. Buses, lottery systems, permits, closures, and still the crowds swarm like moths to a flame. What’s that old proverb? If you love it, let it go.

  “…the near constant head-shaking necessitated by seeing the endless crowds of tourists desperately angling for their next social media masterpiece at the expense of the park.”

  All that said, we gave it a half point on crowds because there actually are a few areas of the park that are not completely overrun, like Kolob Terrace and Kolob Canyons. In those parts of the park you can actually enjoy the beauty of the place without the near constant head-shaking necessitated by seeing the endless crowds of tourists desperately angling for their next social media masterpiece (think Angels Landing).

  Named for the cactus emblematic of the southwest, Saguaro National Park is relatively small but packs a punch. Sunsets here are among the best in the US worth the trip in and of themselves. A visit to Saguaro in winter is just what the doctor ordered for most Americans living in places where that nagging cold weather’s a real drag.

  The park’s close proximity to Tucson makes it a worthwhile and easy stop for folks who happen to be in the area. Sunsets here are truly magical and visitors from outside the area will be surprised at just how large the saguaro cacti can be.

  Saguaro moved up a staggering eighteen places in this year’s rankings. Why? As other parks are swamped with massive crowds, Saguaro is not. Additionally, it’s one of the most accessible parks with numerous ADA accessible trails, lots of roads, and easy access to a major city.

  This year Shenandoah moved up eight places as a result of our new formula. While it doesn’t have a massive volcanic mountain, or Yosemite valley, its accessibility, amenities, and reasonable crowds bring it into the top half of parks on our list.

  The greater of the two Texas parks both in size and scenery, Big Bend is a hot time, quite literally. If you’re visiting during pretty much any season other than winter you need to come prepared with plenty of water and snacks. This park’s proximity to the Mexican border (right on it) means temperatures soar in spring and summer often climbing into the triple digits.

  This year Big Bend was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new formula moving up a massive eighteen places. Low crowds, great scenery, nice amenities, and abundant recreation make for a great score. If not for the remoteness of the park (it is out in the middle of nowhere – we’re talking 4.5hours from a major airport or city) it would rank much higher on this list.

  Canyonlands is one of the parks that has views that one can seemingly gaze upon for days without losing interest or truly comprehending the vastness of the landscape. Mesa Arch here represents one of the most photographed (and beautiful) sunrises in all of the national park system while Green River Overlook offers one of the most dazzling sunsets. It’s also devoid of the crowds found in some other Utah national parks (like its neighbor Arches).

  The catch? Four-wheel drive. If you’ve got it you’re set and have full access to all of the unbelievable destinations the park has to offer. Without it, your time in the park will be mostly limited to overlooks and a few trails from above, which are still well worth the trip.

  Located directly adjacent to Sequoia National Park and featuring similar scenery (the second largest tree on the planet lives here) and even a similar lodge you might be asking yourself why it ranks so much lower.

  Well, it’s a matter of accessibility, burned areas, crowds, and the sequoia groves here aren’t quite as gorgeous or plentiful as those you’ll find down the road. As we’ve received extensive questions about this contrast over the years allow me to clarify further.

  Accessibility in our formula not only refers to getting into the park but also what is accessible within the park. Sequoia has more developed roads, trails, campgrounds, and lodging than Kings Canyon. Call it national park snobbery spoiled with a wealth of natural splendor, but here we are.

  As one of the more accessible Alaska parks, Wrangell makes it into our top 25 US national parks for that reason alone. Wrangell is an Alaska national park full of superlatives and a world unto itself. It is a park of otherworldly and seemingly impossible landscapes. The difference at Wrangell vs most of Alaska’s national parks is that you can actually take a car and drive to some of them.

  Wrangell St. Elias National Park is the largest national park in the US at over 13 million acres. The park features 9 of the 16 tallest mountain peaks in the country. If Wrangell were a state, it would be larger than Connecticut, Delaware, and Rhode Island.

  Now, the drive is a bit of a trek at around 5 hours to get from Anchorage to get to McCarthy, where visitors can access the historic Kennecot mine and Root Glacier.

  Kenai Fjords is perhaps the most accessible of Alaska’s national parks. Unlike most other national parks in Alaska, there is actual driving in the park (however limited) that allows access to hiking trails. Of these hikes, the Harding Icefield Trail is one of the finest most spectacular hikes in the entire national parks system.

  There’s also regular boat tours out of Seward that take visitors by many of the most breathtaking areas and sites. Couple that with its close proximity to the major city of Anchorage with regular commercial flights and we’ve got ourselves a real winner.

  Why did it drop so far in the rankings this year? A re-evaluation of the parks amenities and accessibility. While it’s true you can drive into Kenai Fjords, you can’t get very far. The rest of this vast park must be accessed by boat or bush plane.

  Known for its reptiles, Everglades National Park represents the best chance people have to see the American Alligator in a national park. While the park itself is actually quite massive (third largest in the lower 48), the hike-able regions of it are somewhat limited. The best user experience is on a boat and the most popular iteration of this is the fan boat where folks can travel at high speeds and cover a lot of ground.

  Moving up nineteen places in this year’s rankings one might think there was some sort of expansion to Everglades National Park. There wasn’t. The park moved up the second most of any of the parks thanks to the new formula. The interesting part here is that the scenery score is relatively low comparatively. Consider Everglades as the Pete Rose of this list – not the most talented but gets the job done. Very accessible, plenty of recreation, improving amenities (they got a new hotel within the park!), and manageable crowds are a recipe for success.

  One of Florida’s many parks, Everglades is a great addition to any south Florida trip.

The scenery here is magnificent, rivaling most of the other Utah parks, and you practically have the place to yourself. Here you’ll find lots of great day-hikes and truly out of this world stargazing opportunities (pun intended).

  The deepest lake in America is one of the seven wonders of Oregon and is surprisingly the state’s only national park. The kind of blue water that exists here is unlike any other in the world – you have to see it to believe it. While the park itself is fairly remote and requires quite a drive to access, trust us, it’s worth it.

  In the summer a ferry runs to and from Wizard island where folks can get a unique view of the surrounding area and taking a dip in the lake is a popular activity. In the winter, cross country skiing, snowshoeing, and backcountry camping are popular among the hardy outdoors enthusiast. Crater Lake actually sees more snowfall than almost every other park in the lower 48.

  Arches National Park is perhaps the most interactive of all the Utah parks filled with scenery that brings out the child in all of us. Sandstone hallways and tunnels, rocks to climb on and over, sandy trails perfect for sandals or even bare feet at times, and red rock vistas that make for an unforgettable experience.

  Is the park a bit one-dimensional? Sure. Does it get crowded? Big time and increasingly so. It seems the word is out about Arches and the visitor experience has definitely been diminished as a result. Recently a reservation system was installed to better manage the hoards hoping to get in. It’s for these reasons that Arches dropped twelve spots on this year’s list.

  With that being said, if you’re making the pilgrimage to Moab, put the mountain bike away for a day or two and get out and hike this park, you’ll be so glad you did.

Sunsets here are absolutely magnificent as the light sweeps across the seemingly unending landscapes of striped hills and plains.

  This is a park that’s score doesn’t feel like it quite captures the magnificence of the park. Accessibility, limited recreation opportunities outside of hiking and camping, as well as a lack of amenities bring this park down in our new formula.

  Clocking in as one of the least visited parks in the entire system (including the Alaska parks), Isle Royale is a place often overlooked by park-goers. Its location, a network of 450 islands (mostly very small) out in Lake Superior, makes it difficult to get to. But for those few who make it each year, the scenery is worthwhile. The fact that you cannot drive to the park seems to serve as quite the deterrent to visitors. Getting to the main island requires a 2 hour ferry ride (the shortest route) and costs $60-100 per passenger.

  Moving up thirteen spots in this year’s rankings is no easy feat! The reason for this is low crowds, lots of recreation (albeit largely water based), and a surprising amount of amenities. Were it not for the remote location Isle Royale would rank much higher. Fans of the park can take solace in hoarding its wonders largely to themselves.

  However, the scenery here, while beautiful, doesn’t change past the main viewing area near Sunset Point. Add the crowds here which are tour bus large, with the relative small size of the park and we arrive at 5th out of five.

  The scenery here is mesmerizing and warrants the same long gazes afforded to places like the Grand Canyon and Yosemite. The major drawback here is its distance from, well everything, and out-of-the-way relativity to national park road trips. If you do make it out you’ll be handsomely rewarded.

Despite that subtraction the place is otherworldly (very mars-esque) and presents a rare opportunity to see lava (or at least its effects depending on whether it’s active during your visit) up close.

  This park is always changing as eruptions over the past few decades have both created and destroyed park attractions. The Thurston Lava tube is amazing to hike through and the tropical birds that can be viewed here are rare and beautiful.

  This year, a re-evaluation of the accessibility of this magical place dropped it nine spots in the rankings.

Getting to the park is exceedingly difficult, requiring a flight and then either another flight or ferry. It also comes with quite a hefty price tag and for that reason it ranks lower on our list despite the incredible sites.

  There’s a national park in the Virgin Islands!? Yes! And it’s everything you could imagine and more.

Warm crystal waters, palm trees, white sand beaches, sea turtles, iguanas, ocean sunsets, Trunk Bay, and more await you here.

  Getting to the island is a bit tricky as you have to fly to the neighboring island of St. Thomas first, rent a car, and then take the car on the ferry to St. John where the park is located. The layout of this park is a bit funky, somewhat like that of Acadia with roads on St. John that lead in and out of the park (sometimes without even realizing you’ve left).

  We’ve all seen the famous bearcam of the grizzlies hunting salmon at Brooks Falls, and we all want to see that in person (safely behind the plexiglass viewing area) along with the countless other hard-to-fathom landscapes that exist within this amazing park.

  The fact of the matter is that it just ain’t easy (or cheap) to do so. Getting to Katmai typically requires multiple flights and thousands of dollars which puts it squarely out of reach for most Americans. Accessing Katmai National Park is expensive. There are no roads that lead into the park which means getting to Katmai requires a flight (and not on a commercial flight).

  Brooks Falls Bear Watching – The world famous Katmai National Park bear camera resides at Brooks Falls. Getting to Brooks Falls is not cheap requiring yet another non-commercial flight. From King Salmon it the cost to Brooks Falls is around $300. Once here, behold the best bear viewing on the planet via a safe viewing platform.

  Now you’re definitely not alone in wondering “did they forget Acadia!?” We did not. But maybe some folks should… Acadia is routinely one of the top ten most visited national parks in America despite being one of the smallest. But let’s talk about the good stuff first.

  Along the rocky shores of Maine’s coast you’ll find this easternmost national park. Once the exclusive domain of the gilded age elite, a few civic-minded residents decided to make Acadia’s beauty available to all Americans by donating the land to the national park service – and boy are we glad they did. With rounded mountains, shimmering lakes (called ponds here) , rugged coastline, and forests dotted with old stone roads and trails this New England national park is a real treasure. Fall brings some of the best foliage in the parks system to Acadia and is not to be missed.

  All that being said, the park could benefit from less folks visiting (sorry not sorry Bar Harbor). Crowding can be a real issue in the summer as tourist buses and cars fill the park and parking becomes very scarce. We dock it a few points for accessibility as well – it’s pretty remote, and flights into Bangor aren’t the easiest to come by.

  Lake Clark is home to some of the most extraordinary landscape scenery on the planet. Add in the vast array of wildlife present in the park and you’ve got a real home run.

  The only problem, as is the case with most of the Alaska parks, is getting there. Getting to Lake Clark, while not quite as difficult as Gates of the Arctic or Kobuk Valley, is still pretty darn tough. Visitors must take a seasonal ferry or small plane to reach jumping off points into the park. The cost for all this? Substantial.

  This park falls into the underrated category in our national parks rankings for sure. It’s a place full of superlatives. Great Basin is an anomaly in the high desert of Nevada and rises from the hot desert floor with very little vegetation, up into lush coniferous forests high above. There is even a glacier in the park – in Nevada – how wild is that!

  The park features alpine lakes, and our favorite part, groves of ancient Bristlecone Pines (we’re talking thousands of years old). Fall is a great time to see the park as the foliage is pretty grand. Accessibility and amenities really hurt the score of an otherwise lovely park. Visit and you won’t be disappointed.

  Petrified Forest holds a special place in our hearts as the first national park we ever visited and the place where we fell in love with America’s public lands. Upon arriving we were dazzled by blue mesas, striped hills, warm winds, distant storms, rainbows, petroglyphs, and the most beautiful collection of rocks (petrified wood – leave it there) we have ever seen. Oh and no crowds!

  We docked it some points due to its lack of amenities – unfortunately there are no campgrounds in the park (there is camping though across the interstate in a pretty sad area). With that said, located right off the I-40 in Arizona, Petrified is a great park to add to your next southwest road trip.

  Almost. Accessibility is an issue here as it’s kinda out in the middle of nowhere. While not quite as remote as its sister Texas park, Big Bend, it’s still a long drive to get here. The good news is that it’s right next to Carlsbad Caverns and not too far (3 hours) from White Sands. Sounds like the makings of a great road trip!

  National park + Hawaii – what’s not to like? Located on the island of Maui, this tropical park is a feast for the eyes with two main areas to explore. The crater is all the rage and has been deemed “the greatest sunrise in the national parks” by many… if you can beat the crowds (which are substantial and thus seeing it requires a reservation) and get lucky with the weather. The other section is the more tropical side (near Hana) with jaw-dropping waterfalls, ocean, palm trees, and rain forest.

Throw in some coniferous forests and prairie dog towns and we’ve got ourselves a destination!

  Today, White Sands has achieved park status, and if you can figure a way to add it to a road trip (without adding 8 hours), it is definitely worth the stop! Boardwalks out into the sands make for a great user experience. The white color of the sand is dazzling (pack the sunglasses) and unlike anything we’ve experienced.

  As this park gets more infrastructure it’s likely to rise in the rankings.

  Deemed “the American Galapagos”, Channel Islands feature an unbelievable amount of biodiversity. Located just off the coast of Southern California, this eight island chain is another bucket-lister for park-lovers.

  Getting to the islands themselves presents a bit of difficulty as visitors have to take a ferry and usually make reservations well in advance. Once arriving to the islands activities including hiking, kayaking, diving, and relaxing.

  Amenities are a bit limited so make sure to pack water and food for your trip. It hurts us that such a beautiful national park is ranked so low but alas access & amenities are the key issues here.

  That being said, accessing the best scenery is impossible without a boat and as such it scores low in our rankings.

Congaree has some really cool canoeing/kayaking trails, elevated boardwalks, bald cypress trees (which are quite beautiful), and underrated displays of fall foliage.

  While it might be best to avoid Congaree during late spring & the summer months (skeeters), other times of the year are fair game. The scenery here just doesn’t compare to most national parks and given its relative small size we find it in its rightful places near the bottom of the list.

  It’s a shame to rank such a beautiful national park so low on our list… A picture-perfect postcard of tropical paradise, American Samoa National Park is a bucket list park for NPS enthusiasts. Crystal blue waters meet tall, lush mountains in the heart of the South Pacific creating one of the dreamiest looking national parks in the system.

  Getting there, however, is going to cost you. Average flight prices from the mainland US typically range from $1,800 – $3,000 putting it out of reach for most of us. Once there, exploring the park’s incredible beauty isn’t exactly easy either with relatively few hiking trails and very limited park facilities. Beyond that, there are practically no amenities within the park making it even more difficult to enjoy. Maybe that’s the point.

Its location near Cleveland makes it an easy stop for any park-lover to add on their trip to the city.

  Dry Tortugas is one of the few “tropical” national parks in the system which is reason-alone to make the trip. And making the trip is half the fun. Getting to this park requires an additional plane ride from Key West or ferry ride out to the island. Once there, visitors can snorkel, swim, relax, and otherwise enjoy the remains (well-intact) of Fort Jefferson.

  Facilities are quite limited on the island and if you’re camping make sure to pack all of your own food and water.

  Last but, well, least…

  We were not alone in our head-scratching upon hearing the news that Gateway Arch had been elevated to full park status alongside the likes of Yellowstone and Yosemite. Receiving a coveted congressional designation as a national park is usually a long and hard fought process with long justification statements and passionate debate.

  In this case the justification statement is a mere paragraph long and does not, in and of itself, hold up to the criteria set forth by congress. We are very much for the creation of new parks and different kinds of parks, but the system we have allows for diverse designations. Would not a National Historic Site or National Historic Park designation be more fitting in this case?

  We’re calling this a national park, really?

  Typically parks under consideration need to demonstrate a need for the designation which was not done so (at least publicly) in this case. When the bill to create this was brought to the house floor it seems that getting it done quickly so that it could be celebrated by the 4th of July was a leading justification for elevating it to park status.

  Clocking in at 62 acres it is by far the smallest park and could fit into the next smallest park (Hot Springs) more than 88 times with room to spare. The question we are left asking ourselves is what sort of political, backroom horse trading was done in order to slap the “National Park” tag on the arch? Might make for some interesting investigative journalism…

  What Qualifies As A US National Park?

  There seems to be some confusion out there about what exactly qualifies as a “national park” in the United States, so let’s clear that up.

  There are many different types of designations within the national park system, like national monuments, national historical parks, national battlefields, national historic sites, national parks, and so on.

  Each one of these specific designations carries with it a different meaning, a different type of administration, and affords the area different levels of protection.

  For a more in-depth explanation of these designations visit our article that explains the different National Park Service designations and their meanings, What Exactly Is A National Park?

  How Many National Parks Are There In The USA?

  To be clear, there are 63 national parks in the US which are part of a system that includes 423 national park sites. National parks can only be designated by an act of congress – unlike many other units in the national park system which can gain their designation through executive action or even secretarial orders.

  National historical parks, for instance, are not national parks, even though they contain the phrase “national park” in their title. Confused yet? The same goes for national preserves, national monuments and anything else that is not simply named “[Insert Name] National Park”. But don’t take our word for it, you can read all about these different designations here.

  The National Park System

  The national park system is full of incredible places that constitute the all-important natural and cultural heritage of the United States. These special places, from Gettysburg National Military Park to Yosemite National Park, are of immense importance and are equally deserving of preservation and administration that fits their unique place in the story of this country.

  So whether your favorite national park service unit is a national park, a national monument, a national recreation area, or any other type of designation, the point is they’re all important, but there’s only 63 congressionally-designated “national parks”.

  Read on to discover the best national parks in the U.S., a selection based on expert recommendations and winners in our most recent World’s Best Awards .

  If you’re someone who has set their sights on checking off one, two, or all of these protected lands, you’re not alone. The National Park Service reported 325.5 million recreation visits in 2023, with national parks, specifically, making up 28 percent of that number. While many travelers make it a goal to explore as many national parks as possible, others may only be interested in seeing the top ones. No matter which bucket you fall into, the list below should help with your trip planning.

  On March 1, 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant signed the bill establishing Yellowstone as the first national park in the United States. Since that historic day, over 60 destinations have received the title of national park, bringing the grand total to 63 in December 2020 with the addition of New River Gorge National Park and Preserve. Spread out across 31 states and two U.S. territories, national parks join forces with other National Park System areas — battlefields, military parks, monuments, historical parks, historic sites, seashores, lakeshores, scenic rivers and trails, recreation areas, and the White House — to cover more than 85 million acres of mountains, dense forests, deserts, rock formations, and other incredible natural wonders.

  01 of 20 Yellowstone National Park Yellowstone National Park. Vince Fergus/Travel + Leisure Those who have experienced the wonder of Yellowstone can attest to the grandeur and awe-inspiring nature of the park, a majority of which is located in Wyoming. According to Kevin Jackson, the CEO of luxury travel company EXP Journeys, Yellowstone stands out due to its hydrothermal features and amazing wildlife. Don’t Miss: There are over 10,000 geysers, mud pots, hot springs, travertine terraces, and fumaroles in the 2.2-million-acre park — with Old Faithful, the Norris Geyser Basin, and Grand Prismatic Spring being three of the most popular sites to visit. Want to get a glimpse of bison, elk, bear, or other wildlife? Jackson recommends Lamar Valley, an area he says is “often considered the Serengeti of the U.S. for the wide variety of wildlife that can be seen here.”

  02 of 20 Great Smoky Mountains National Park Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Valerie de Leon/Travel + Leisure Jeff Powell, the owner of National Park Ventures and Smoky Mountains Ventures, says the most-visited national park receives points for several reasons. For starters, it’s extremely family-friendly. “There's hiking for visitors of all ages, as well as dozens of waterfalls to enjoy. Kids will enjoy playing in the numerous creeks throughout the park,” he says. The mountain scenery also plays a pivotal role, and, he adds, “the park really delivers in every season, whether it's spring flowers, summer activities, fall colors, or winter snowscapes.” Don’t Miss: A trip to Great Smoky Mountains National Park wouldn’t be complete without a bit of hiking; Deep Creek Loop Trail, Caldwell Fork Trail, or even a section of the Appalachian Trail that runs through the park are all good options. Most visitors make their way to Cataloochee Valley to see the elk population, and the famous wildflowers can be spotted in various places (though starting with one of the park’s wildflower walks will certainly put you in the right direction).

  03 of 20 Virgin Islands National Park Virgin Islands National Park. Lauren Breedlove/Travel + Leisure Virgin Islands National Park and its unspoiled beaches and coral reefs, hiking trails, tropical forests, and cultural sites encompass two-thirds of the island of St. John plus over 5,600 acres of adjacent submerged lands. It’s a multi-faceted destination that allows travelers to experience natural beauty and heart-pumping activities and learn about the island’s history of sugar production and enslaved labor. Don’t Miss: Snorkel around Trunk Bay or Hawksnest Bay, hike the three-hour Reef Bay Trail, and leave time to visit Annaberg Plantation, which was once the largest sugar-producing estate on the island. Here, you’ll discover ruins of the sugar factory and the homes of enslaved people and get a detailed history of the area from the on-site docents.

  04 of 20 Grand Teton National Park Main road in Grand Teton National Park. Irjaliina Paavonpera/Travel + Leisure One of Jackson Hole, Wyoming’s biggest draws, Grand Teton National Park is a dream destination for sightseers and adventurers. “With the Tetons towering over the valley floor and the Snake River running the center, the park offers exceptional fly fishing, biking, paddle boarding, hiking, and mountaineering,” says Jackson. Plus, he adds, it’s also “home to a wide variety of wildlife, including both black and grizzly bears, bison, moose, elk, pronghorn, and many more.” Don’t Miss: To hit many of the high points in the park — including Oxbow Bend, Moulton Barns on Mormon Row, Schwabacher Landing, and Jackson Lake — drive the 42-mile circular route along Highway 89 and Teton Park Road (the park’s “Outer Road” and “Inner Road”). If hiking is your priority, Jackson recommends String Lake and Jenny Lake. Just remember to bring the proper supplies (water, bear spray, and layers), and pack your swimsuit for a refreshing post-hike dip.

  05 of 20 Rocky Mountain National Park Rocky Mountain National Park. Griffin Ungar/Travel + Leisure With an elevation that ranges from 7,600 feet to 14,259 feet above sea level, Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the highest national parks in the US. It’s also a destination that has a cornucopia of natural wonders, including glacial lakes, magnificent sunsets and sunrises, and abundant wildlife (including elk, moose, bighorn sheep, and more). Don’t Miss: Drive the highest continuous paved road in the United States, Trail Ridge Road, or explore the wilderness by foot. The national park boasts over 350 miles of hiking trails, but Bear Lake, Emerald Lake, Coyote Valley, and Cascade Falls are some of the best.

  06 of 20 Glacier National Park Glacier National Park. Irjaliina Paavonpera/Travel + Leisure The “high alpine lakes, glacier-carved valleys, and sharp peaks” make Glacier National Park one of Jackson’s all-time favorites. Located in northwest Montana, the park is a year-round destination where visitors can hike, swim, see fall foliage, and cross-country ski — all while admiring the mountain views. Don’t Miss: “Hiking the Highline Trail from Logan Pass is a must-see but requires some planning,” says Jackson. “To reach the trail, you have to drive up to Logan Pass, which is part of Going-to-the-Sun Road.” The latter is a 50-mile-long scenic drive that runs between West Glacier and St. Mary, with plenty of photo ops along the way. “In addition to the scenery, there is great wildlife viewing, and going to the east side of the park to Many Glacier Lodge is a great place to see bear, moose, big horn sheep, and elk,” he says.

  07 of 20 Big Bend National Park Large canyon in Big Bend National Park. Vince Fergus/Travel + Leisure Everything is bigger in Texas, and that includes Big Bend, one of the Lone Star State’s two national parks. Stretching across West Texas — and covering the Chisos mountain range and part of the Chihuahuan Desert — the park features scenic drives, hundreds of miles of hiking trails, hot springs, and access to the Rio Grande. Don’t Miss: In Big Bend, you can hike across the desert, mountains, and river. Not sure where to start? Try the Santa Elena Canyon or Balanced Rock Trails. Kayaking the Rio Grande is another favorite activity, and many travelers take advantage of the fact that Big Bend is also an International Dark Sky Park, opting to stargaze during their trip.

  08 of 20 Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park Small eruption in Hawaii Volcanos National Park. Laura La Monaca/Travel + Leisure "Most people visit Hawai’i for the beaches, but there is much more to the islands,” says Powell, who recommends Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park. He calls the park, which is located on the Big Island, “a fascinating paradise featuring volcanoes, rainforests, otherworldly lava fields, and exotic tropical flowers.” The two active volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea, are highlights for many travelers, but the 335,000-acre park also features more than 150 miles of hiking trails and other sightseeing opportunities. Don’t Miss: Drive the Chain of Craters Road to see where the park meets sea level, choose one of the many hikes at the Kahuku Unit (what was once one of the biggest cattle ranches in Hawai’i), and walk through Hawaiian forest via the Kīpukapuaulu Trail.

  09 of 20 Kenai Fjords National Park Icebergs in Kenai Fjords. Sage Dudick/Travel + Leisure Known as the national park “where mountains, ice, and ocean meet,” Kenai Fjords covers more than 600,000 acres of Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula. Its glaciers, rugged mountains, fjords, and wildlife (you may see seals, bears, and whales) are simply stunning, though the changing climate is affecting the size of the glaciers. Don’t Miss: The Harding Icefield, which is partially located within the national park, features around 40 different glaciers and is one of the biggest reasons travelers visit this part of the world. There are only two official trails within the park — the Exit Glacier Trails and Harding Icefield Trail — and the trailhead for both can be found at the end of Exit Glacier Road.

  10 of 20 Shenandoah National Park Shenandoah National Park. Nicholas Schmidt/Travel + Leisure "It would be difficult to overstate the beauty of Shenandoah National Park, located along the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia,” says Powell. “The views are stunning, especially at sunset.” He recommends it as a destination for “families who enjoy camping and immersing themselves in nature,” or anyone hoping to catch the glorious fall foliage that appears every October. Don’t Miss: Wildflower season, which begins in March and goes through October, is one of the most celebrated times of the year in the park. The best places to see the likes of mountain laurels, wild azaleas, and columbines include the South River Falls trail, the Rose River Falls loop, the Big Meadows area, and the 105-mile Skyline Drive.

  11 of 20 Denali National Park Rolling mountains in Denali National Park. Taylor McIntyre/Travel + Leisure For Jackson, the appeal of Denali National Park is two-fold: the mountain range (home to North America's tallest mountain) and the wildlife. “The park spans over six million acres of rugged wilderness, and much of it is accessible only by foot or plane,” he says, noting that the park allows for off-trail hiking in many areas, “giving visitors the freedom to explore its vast landscapes with a true sense of adventure.” Don’t Miss: Some travelers come in search of Alaska’s version of the “Big Five”: grizzly bears, moose, caribou, wolves, and Dall sheep. “Places such as Sable Pass and Teklanika River are hot spots for wildlife viewing,” says Jackson. Visitors can also expect to find memorable views from the Mountain Vista Loop Trail and Horseshoe Lake — or while looking up at auroras in the night sky.

  12 of 20 Zion National Park Zion National Park. Don Eim/Travel + Leisure To see what Powell describes as “spectacular mountain and desert landscapes,” you’ll need to make the trek to Utah’s Zion National Park. A geological masterpiece, this is a place where canyoneering, rock climbing, and biking are all possible, though many travelers opt to drive the Kolob Canyons Road, embark on a horseback riding tour, or kayak down the Virgin River. Don’t Miss: “The best thing about Zion National Park is the assortment of unique hikes,” explains Powell. “The Narrows trail is through the Virgin River — the whole hike is done wading through the water. Angels Landing is a harrowing yet beautiful hike along a narrow trail leading to amazing views. The Subway hike involves climbing down waterfalls and scrambling over boulders,” he says. Powell also mentions that Zion is located within driving distance of Bryce Canyon National Park, Capitol Reef National Park, Canyonlands National Park, and Arches National Park: “These parks, collectively known as The Mighty Five, make for an unforgettable road trip.”

  13 of 20 Capitol Reef National Park Fruita Barn in Capitol Reef National Park. jenifoto/Getty Images Jackson describes south-central Utah’s Capitol Reef National Park as an amazing destination for “excellent hiking, canyoneering, Native American sites, and, of course, apple picking in Fruita,” the heart of the park. Known for its varying rock formations, Capitol Reef surrounds Waterpocket Fold, a 100-mile-long “wrinkle” in the Earth where rocks have been pushed upward and erosion has created narrow canyons and other geological features. Don’t Miss: “Cathedral Valley is a unique geologic region of the park, offering great walks and exceptional scenery,” he says, also noting that Grand Wash is one of his favorite hikes. Other popular spots include the white sandstone domes, Chimney Rock pillar, and the Hickman Bridge arch.

  14 of 20 Haleakalā National Park Haleakala Crater National Park. Westend61/Getty Images “Haleakalā National Park is a place of contrasts,” says Powell. “You can stand on a mountaintop 10,000 feet above sea level, looking down on the clouds below, or you can sit at sea level and watch the waves roll in. There are waterfalls to explore and trails to be hiked through volcanic craters or lush tropical forests.” Don’t Miss: Watching the sunrise from Haleakalā is an extremely popular activity that requires a reservation. The remote park is also ideal for stargazing and wildlife viewing; keep an eye out for nēnē (the Hawaiian state bird), the Hawaiian petrel, frogs, fish, deer, Hawaiian monk seals, and bats.

  15 of 20 Grand Canyon National Park Grand Canyon National Park. Jyotsna Bhamidipati/Travel + Leisure “With almost two billion years of geologic time exposed in the canyon, this park is special for what it can tell us about the past,” says Jackson. Along with its awe-inspiring rock layers and formations, Grand Canyon National Park is famous for its outdoor activities — namely hiking and rafting. He adds that rafting through the inner gorge like John Wesley Powell, the first person of European descent to successfully raft the entire canyon, has been called the “trip of a lifetime.” Don’t Miss: “The North Rim of the Grand Canyon is a great place to visit as it has significantly fewer visitors and is much cooler in the summer months,” says Jackson, though the South Rim is where you’ll find the Grand Canyon Visitor Center and the start of the scenic Desert View Drive.

  16 of 20 Mount Rainier National Park Mount Rainier Naitonal Park. Irjaliina Paavonpera/Travel + Leisure Come to Washington’s Mount Rainier National Park for the 14,410-foot mountain and active volcano, and stay for the wildflowers, hiking trails, and ancient forest. Just southeast of Seattle, the park provides plenty of opportunities for visitors to hike, camp, climb, and snowshoe. Don’t Miss: From late July through August, check out the flowers at the Reflection Lakes Trail and the Grand Park meadow. Sunrise Road typically doesn’t open until late June or early July, and it leads to the 6,400-foot-high Sunrise Point, the highest point in the park that can be reached by vehicle. If you want close-up views of Mount Rainier and the Nisqually Glacier, hike the 5.5-mile Skyline Trail Loop.

  17 of 20 Yosemite National Park El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. Valerie de Leon/Travel + Leisure Yosemite National Park, located in California’s Sierra Nevada mountain range, has an impressive resume — from being one of the very first national parks to its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It also has five of the tallest waterfalls on earth, over 1,500 species of plants, and three groves of giant sequoias. Don’t Miss: Yosemite Valley is one of the most popular destinations within the park, as visitors are granted views of El Capitan, Half Dome, and Yosemite Falls. Tunnel View, right outside the Wawona Tunnel, is another great spot for photos. To see over 500 mature giant sequoias, you’ll want to head to Mariposa Grove.

  18 of 20 Sequoia National Park Sequoia National Park. Ziga Plahutar/Getty Images As the name suggests, Sequoia National Park is known for its giant sequoia trees — and there are about 40 different giant sequoia groves within the park’s boundaries. Notably, the KNP Complex Fire in 2021 burned 16 sequoia groves (some trees did survive), which lived almost totally on NPS land. Don’t Miss: The 2,200-year-old Sherman Tree — the largest living tree and largest living organism, by volume, in the world — can be found in Giant Forest. Other spots to see include Hospital Rock, Crescent Meadow, and Moro Rock.

  19 of 20 Bryce Canyon National Park Sunset Overlook in Bryce Canyon National Park. Taylor McIntyre/Travel + Leisure Jackson describes Bryce Canyon as “one of those parks that, when you walk up to the rim, it makes you say, ‘wow.’” It’s even more gorgeous at sunrise or sunset, when he says “the colors pop as if the hoodoos are on fire.” It’s these spire-shaped rock columns, along with unparalleled stargazing conditions, that give the 56-square-mile park its notoriety. Don’t Miss: Bryce Amphitheater is home to the greatest concentration of hoodoos on Earth, and you can get incredible views of it from places like Inspiration Point, Bryce Point, Sunset Point, and Sunrise Point. If you want to get in some hiking, Jackson recommends the Fairyland Loops Trail.

These protected lands, from coast to coast, safeguard and showcase untamed wilderness with awe-inspiring beauty and diverse wildlife ecosystems.

  Today, there are more than 400 sites in the National Park Service, including 63 major parks—from America's first national park, Yellowstone, to lesser-known ones in destinations like southern Texas, which straddles the Mexican border (Big Bend), and northern Minnesota, which straddles the Canadian border (Voyageurs).
