The proliferation of remote work during the Covid-19 pandemic reflected the harsh realities of coping with a deadly communicable disease. While some heralded the development as a net positive for employers and employees alike, others were less convinced. Articles and op-eds proclaiming it was bad for business and for the careers of those who didn’t want to return to offices popped up on a regular basis.

As the pandemic slowed nationwide, corporate offices (subscription required) began issuing return-to-office edicts—with mixed reception, to say the least. Now, a new narrative seems to be taking hold: “Work from home is over. Everybody, back to the cubicles!”

But the truth is work from home (WFH) is great for employees. And while that should be reason enough to support it, it’s also good for your bottom line. Here are six reasons why.

1. Improved Employee Mental And Physical Health

When your employees feel more in control, they’re better able to maintain good mental health. That can only benefit your organization as a whole through reduced stress, fewer conflicts between work and personal life and increased flexibility. For example, if an employee needs to take a child to the doctor, they can do so when schedules permit and make up their work at more convenient times.

WFH can also be better for your employees’ physical health. They’re more readily able to schedule doctor visits, eat healthier food, work out and practice better self-care habits. This can result in increased productivity and reduced absenteeism.

2. Improved Employee Morale And Engagement

Buffer’s 2022 State of Remote Work survey found that employees overwhelmingly recommend remote work to their colleagues and friends, and 86% of respondents prefer a fully remote or almost fully remote structure to either hybrid or full-time in-office work.

Generally speaking, remote employees report a much higher degree of job satisfaction than those who work in a central office space. That morale boost leads to more employee engagement, which is a proven way to keep experienced employees happy, motivated and loyal. Satisfied employees tend not to jump ship to other opportunities as frequently. As a result, it can reduce your employee turnover as well as the expense of hiring, training and retaining new employees.

3. Increased Employee Productivity

Available data suggests that remote workers are more productive than in-office employees, with fewer defects in work product output and quality. One 2013 study from Stanford University examined a Chinese travel agency’s experience and concluded that remote work boosted performance and productivity by up to 22% over in-office work. In addition, a 2015 survey reported by SHRM concluded that 77% of remote employees reported greater productivity, with 30% reporting that they got more done in less time. By adopting remote-friendly policies, you can empower employees to perform work whenever it’s best for their schedule and preferences.

In some cases, companies can arrange coverage around the clock depending on where team members are based. Virtual work has never been more connected than it is today, with collaboration and communication apps helping to keep far-flung employees in touch. That’s especially valuable to global companies who need to be competitive at all hours.

4. Larger Pool Of Skilled And Qualified Talent

Studies show that many of the most qualified candidates you could hope to attract for your company prioritize remote work. If it’s not available, they’ll keep looking for a better work experience.

With remote work, you can hire the top talent your company needs and deserves. You’re no longer restricted to the choice between hiring in a single location or paying exorbitant relocation costs.

5. Reduced Friction For Employees And Employers

At least half of employers responding to remote work surveys report that working from home reduces employee absenteeism. When you trust your employees to shift their work schedules to accommodate their needs, they’re able to get tasks done more efficiently.

Moreover, they’re saving vast amounts of time each week by forgoing the daily commute, which also reduces absenteeism and increases productivity. Remote work can make managing job duties and other competing obligations less stressful with the understanding that employees are people, first and foremost.

Remote work also makes it easier for employees to manage doctor appointments, check on an ailing parent, accommodate a child’s school schedule or other challenges. By reducing friction for your employees, WFH can benefit the overall organization.

6. Lower Costs For Equipment And Office Space

It stands to reason that if your staff is primarily remote, you won’t need to maintain as much (increasingly expensive) office space. This reduces operating and equipment costs, allowing you to reinvest those funds into more profitable areas, such as employee training, higher salaries or expansion.

One survey suggests that companies can save $11,000 annually on average per part-time remote employee, translating to 21% greater profitability. Moreover, 34% of employees responding to a 2019 Owl Labs survey indicated they’d take a pay cut for a remote position.

Remote Work Policies Are Good For (Your) Business

Obviously, certain industries won’t be able to adopt remote work policies. However, for positions that can be performed remotely, it’s to your company’s advantage to explore a more flexible work environment.

## [17 Key Benefits of Remote Work for Employers and Employees - CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/career-change/benefits-of-remote-work/)
**Snippet:** Learn how remote work can save costs, increase productivity, and improve satisfaction for both businesses and workers. Explore the top nine benefits of remote work for employers and the top eight benefits for employees, based on research and examples.

**Cleaned Text:**
Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, many companies have shifted to a remote workforce or hybrid work model and are now seeing the benefits of remote work for the first time.

While early predictions suggested that this new trend was a passing fad likely to end with the pandemic, it’s now clear that remote work is here to stay.

In fact, a recent study investigating the process of remote work adoption by US organizations found that the model has become a widespread and increasingly standard workplace practice.

This is great news for tech workers and those hoping to change careers, as it opens up a wealth of new opportunities. But what are the key advantages of remote work for employees and employers?

In this post, we’ll explore the following topics to help you understand why this work model is growing in popularity:

What are the most important advantages of remote work?

Remote work, work-from-home, or telecommuting, has exploded in popularity for several reasons. For starters, it can help businesses save on workplace costs such as rent, utilities, and furniture.

And with the rise of high-speed internet and mobile devices, it’s easier than ever for employees to stay connected and productive from anywhere in the world.

Cost-effectiveness and productivity are, therefore, among the most commonly cited advantages of remote work. But beyond these economic effects, there are many other benefits of remote work that appeal to both employers and employees.

Let’s break this down and consider the most important advantages of remote work from both perspectives, starting with the two just mentioned.

The top 9 benefits of remote work for employers

Organizations might want to adopt a remote work policy for many good reasons, including economic, social, and environmental ones.

To give you an overview, here are the top nine benefits of remote work for employers, based on our research:

1. Increased cost-efficiency

As mentioned, one of the most significant advantages of remote work for business managers is its cost-effectiveness. With no need to rent or maintain office space, businesses can save a considerable amount of money by allowing employees to work from home.

And given the rising energy costs, this will likely become an increasingly important factor in the future.

2. Increased productivity

Another benefit of remote work is that it can increase employee productivity.

A 2021 study investigating contributing factors to remote work productivity during the COVID-19 outbreak found, for example, that self-leadership and autonomy were essential factors in remote workers’ ability to maintain high levels of productivity and engagement.

Improved performance also affects the bottom line by reducing the need for overtime or extra staff.

3. Greater employee satisfaction

The increased satisfaction that remote work can bring employees is another positive effect. This is because the ability to work from home often provides employees with a better work-life balance, which can lead to increased job satisfaction and motivation.

Happy employees are also less likely to leave their jobs, which further reduces staff turnover and associated costs.

4. Reduced absenteeism

Employees who are happy and satisfied with their jobs are also less likely to take time off sick. An analysis of employee data conducted by the Fiduciary Group in 2020 confirmed this.

After the remote work policy was adopted, the Group saw a significant, company-wide drop in sickness days related, among other things, to increased job satisfaction.

5. Greater pool of applicants

When remote work is an option, businesses can cast a wider net when recruiting new employees. Since they’re no longer limited to local candidates, they can tap into a global talent pool.

This gives them a better chance of finding the best possible candidates for the job, thus improving the workforce quality.

6. Better talent retention

In addition to attracting better talent, remote work can help businesses keep the talent they already have. As explained, this is because employees who have the option to work from home are less likely to leave their jobs in search of greener pastures.

Therefore, remote work improves company loyalty and helps businesses save on the costs associated with recruiting and training new employees.

7. Enhanced corporate social responsibility

Recently, there has been an increasing focus on corporate social responsibility. And rightly so, as businesses have a responsibility to act in a way that is ethical and sustainable.

Allowing employees to work from home is an excellent way for companies to reduce their environmental impact, as the carbon emissions associated with business travel, for example, are eliminated.

8. Improved competitiveness

In a globalized economy, businesses need to be able to compete with organizations from all over the world. By offering remote work, they can level the playing field and attract top talent, regardless of location.

This is increasingly important in today’s climate of digital transformation, where businesses need to be agile and adaptable to survive.

9. Better disaster preparedness

It may sound far-fetched, but remote work can help businesses prepare for and respond to disasters.

With a remote work policy in place, enterprises ensure that operations can continue even if their physical premises are affected by a natural disaster, for example. So, a welcome side-effect of this work trend is that it boosts business continuity and resilience.

Having looked at the key advantages of remote work for employers, let’s now discover the benefits employees can enjoy.

The top 8 benefits of remote work for employees

If you’re currently looking for flexible work in the tech space, you’re in luck. There are plenty of great remote work opportunities out there, even for people without much work experience.

But how do you know if remote work is the right fit for you? Maybe the following eight benefits will help you decide.

1. Better work-life balance

The first and most obvious benefit of working remotely is that it gives you the opportunity to create a better work-life balance.

When you’re not tied to a physical office, you can structure your day in a way that works for you and gives you more time for your personal life, including family commitments and social engagements.

2. Greater Flexibility

When you work remotely, you can choose the schedule that works best for you. Flexible hours allow you to take care of personal errands during the day and then make up for the time by working in the evening or on weekends, if necessary.

This is a huge advantage for people who have difficulty fitting traditional work hours into their schedules.

3. Less time commuting

If you live in a big city, you know that commuting can be a huge time-suck. Working remotely eliminates this wasted time, giving you back precious hours to do things you actually enjoy.

In addition, you’ll save money on transportation costs and other commuting-related costs, such as gas or parking fees.

4. More freedom and autonomy

As someone who works remotely, you’ll also have more freedom and autonomy to do your job the way you want to. For instance, you won’t be micromanaged as closely as you might in a traditional office setting.

And you’ll have the opportunity to take more initiative and be more creative in your work.

5. Easier time management

Next on the list of remote work benefits for employees is that this work model can help you manage your time more effectively.

When you’re not constantly interrupted by colleagues or meetings, you can focus more easily on the task at hand and get into a flow state. This is especially beneficial for introverts who may need more quiet time to think and work independently.

6. More effective communication

Remote work can also make communication more effective. This is because remote teams use written communication more than teams in traditional offices, which can lead to more clear and concise communication overall.

Another advantage of written communication is that it can be easily documented and referenced later, which helps to keep track of projects and progress.

7. Comfortable work environment

Another big plus of working remotely is that you can create a work environment that’s more comfortable for you. Whether you prefer working from home or in a co-working space, you can find a setup that suits your needs and helps you be more productive.

Typical personalization options include setting up a standing desk, working in complete silence, or playing music while you work.

8. Fewer distractions

A final advantage to take into account when considering remote work is that you’ll likely experience fewer distractions. In a traditional office setting, it’s easy to get sidetracked by colleagues dropping by your desk, impromptu meetings, or general office chatter.

But when you work remotely, you can set boundaries and establish rules to minimize distractions, thus maximizing your productivity.

We also spoke to some tech employees who are working in either a remote setting or hybrid set-up. In this video, you can find out what they consider the biggest benefits of remote work are, what challenges it presents, and understand how working remotely has impacted their lives:

New work: Why remote is here to stay

Given all these benefits for employers and employees, it’s no surprise that remote work is on the rise.

The future of work, post-Covid 19, is likely to be even more remote-friendly, with more companies offering flexible working arrangements and employees valuing the freedom of working remotely.

But the driving forces behind this new world of work go beyond just the pandemic. They include technological advances, the changing demographic of the workforce, and the rise of the gig economy.

This will continue to transform industries like tech, media, and marketing, which are already highly volatile and fast-paced, in one direction: toward a more decentralized, remote-first model. In that respect, the pandemic has simply accelerated a trend that was already underway.

So, if you’re looking for a career that offers flexibility, autonomy, and the opportunity to work from anywhere, these are the industries to keep an eye on.

Final thoughts

The new world of work is full of opportunities, especially for those willing to embrace change and seize the advantages that remote work offers.

With the many benefits of remote work for employers and employees, it’s here to stay and will continue to shape how we work in the years to come.

There’s never been a better time to pursue a career in a remote-friendly industry. So, if you’re feeling stuck in your current job or looking for a new challenge, now is the time to consider a career move.

## [10 Undeniable Benefits Of Working From Home, According To Science](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/benefits-of-working-from-home-according-to-science_l_660c30a0e4b0328a72be17cd)
**Snippet:** Still, with increased social support and systems put in place by managers and organizations trained in managing hybrid teams, research also suggests there's plenty of benefits to working from home. Below, 10 studies and surveys that quantify just how game-changing remote work can be for employees and companies.

**Cleaned Text:**
Morsa Images via Getty Images Among hybrid workers who are not self-employed, 71% say working for home at least partially helps them balance their work and personal lives.

Four years since the COVID-19 pandemic forced businesses to shut down office spaces around the world, remote and hybrid work seems here to stay.

About a third of U.S. workers who can work from home now do so all the time, according to a Pew Research Center survey from March 2023. (The majority of U.S. workers ― 61% ― do not have jobs that can be done from home, Pew notes.)

Companies that insist on mandatory full-time attendance at the office do so at their own peril; today’s employees value the autonomy that comes with remote or hybrid work and are increasingly leaving workplaces that forget they have lives outside their 9-to-5.

In March 2022, Microsoft’s second annual Worker Trend Index found that 53% of respondents prioritize their health and well-being over work, “and if unhappy, more than half of Gen Z and millennial respondents said [they’d] seriously consider switching employers over the next year.”

Of course, working from home is not without its drawbacks. Many working women say they feel greater conflicts between their job and family roles while teleworking, and studies have shown increased rates of depression and anxiety during remote work. (Though it’s worth noting, most of the research was conducted while respondents were living through an active pandemic ― stressful in its own right.)

Still, with increased social support and systems put in place by managers and organizations trained in managing hybrid teams, research also suggests there’s plenty of benefits to working from home. Below, 10 studies and surveys that quantify just how game-changing remote work can be for employees and companies.

Remote workers experience a better work-life balance.

Prior to the remote work era, a healthy work-life balance often felt like a pie-in-the-sky goal for workers: nice to idly dream about but never quite attainable. Now, it’s more in reach: Among hybrid workers who are not self-employed, 71% say working for home at least partially helps them balance their work and personal lives, according to the Pew Research survey.

They don’t feel micromanaged, either, despite being out of the office and outside the eyeline of their bosses. The same Pew survey found that employees who work from home at least some of the time (71%) say their manager or supervisor trusts them a “great deal” to get their work done when they’re out of the office.

Working remotely can halve an office worker’s carbon footprint.

Working from home isn’t just good for your morale, it’s also pretty good for the planet. According to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last year, people who work remotely all the time produce less than half the greenhouse gas emissions of on-site employees.

Hybrid work arrangements help some, too. Working remotely two or four days a week reduced an individual’s emissions by up to 29% compared with office workers.

In 2015, Xerox reported that its teleworkers drove 92 million fewer miles, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 41,000 metric tons.

FG Trade via Getty Images Working remotely two or four days a week reduced an individual’s emissions by up to 29% compared with office workers.

Remote workers tend to eat more healthy ― up to a point.

Research on remote work can be a little contradictory ― is it good for your mental health or does it lead to depression? ― so in December 2023, British researchers set out to interpret over 1,930 academic papers on teleworking and hybrid work arrangements.

What they found was that people working from home tend to feel lower rates of stress, eat healthier meals and have lower blood pressure.

The study, funded in part by the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, pointed out some negatives, too. One of the studies reviewed found that 46.9% of employees working from home had put on weight. Another study put that number around 41%. Remote workers also tended to drink and smoke more.

A downside for workers: Remote employees work longer hours.

Though working from home is often equated with laziness and low productivity, the aforementioned British study found that remote workers tend to work longer hours and that their work is more likely to bleed into evenings and weekends. Regrettably, they’re also less likely to take sick time.

Another study ― this one tracking more than 60,000 Microsoft employees over the first half of 2020 ― found that remote work led to a 10% boost in weekly hours.

One drawback was less collaboration. The Microsoft study, published in the journal Nature Human Behavior, found that cross-group collaboration dropped by about 25% of the pre-pandemic level.

Less commuting time means more time for work.

Remote employees are working more because they’re spending less time stuck in traffic. One 2023 University of Chicago study looked at data from 27 countries and found that remote workers saved 72 minutes in daily commuting time. On average, employees spent about half an hour of that extra time engaged in daily work, which comes out to more than two hours a week.

Since the pandemic, some social scientists have highlighted the downside to eliminating the daily commute: In one 2022 study published in the Organizational Psychology Review, researchers argued that commutes are a source of healthy “liminal space” — a time free of constraints from work and home that gives people a chance to recover from the workday and mentally prepare for reentering the home.

“Without the ability to mentally shift gears, people experience role blurring, which can lead to stress,” the study’s co-authors wrote in The Conversation. “Without mentally disengaging from work, people can experience burnout.”

Remote or hybrid work options may help with employee retention.

Worried about losing your employees to more enticing offers? Give them the chance to work from home. In 2019, video conferencing company Owl Labs surveyed 1,200 U.S. workers between the ages of 22 and 65 and found that remote workers were 13% more likely to stay in their current job for the next five years than on-site workers.

When asked if the opportunity to work remotely would make them happier, 83% of the survey respondents agreed, while 80% agreed that working remotely would make them feel like their employer cares.

People of color say they’re able to manage stress better working from home.

More Black professionals want flexible work policies than their white, Asian and Latino colleagues, according to a 2021 study conducted by The Future Forum, a research consortium organized by Slack.

Black workers reported a 50% increase in their sense of workplace belonging and a 64% increase in their ability to manage stress when they began working from home.

In the wake of the pandemic and office closures, many Black Americans spoke of how draining microaggressions in their office environments can be.

“Most of my interactions with my co-workers are very focused on the work that we’re doing, and for me, I appreciate that,” Christina, a Black software engineer, told HuffPost in 2021 after switching to remote work. “Sometimes hearing your co-worker’s opinions on current events are not really the most inclusive opinion. It’s nice that I don’t have to delve into that with them.“

FG Trade via Getty Images Black workers reported a 50% increase in their sense of workplace belonging and a 64% increase in their ability to manage stress when they began working from home.

Mothers and caregivers report higher rates of well-being with hybrid work.

A March 2023 study out of the University of Melbourne found that women ― especially mothers and caregivers ― reported improved well-being when they’re given the option to work from home. The researchers posited that such flexibility helps women balance paid employment with unpaid caregiving and household duties, which women disproportionately bear the brunt of.

Remote work has been a benefit for people with disabilities, too.

Workers with disabilities appreciate the option to work from home because it reduces transportation and accessibility challenges they face going into the office every day. It also allows them to better manage chronic health conditions.

“Before COVID-19, work from home was generally not popular, and disabled people had to try hard to get these accommodations,” Meenakshi Das, a software engineer focused on accessibility, told HuffPost in 2021. “It took a pandemic for people to realize how accommodations are low-cost and totally doable, and I hope it stays that way.”

There’s benefits for employers, too. Almost two-thirds of disabled employees believe they were more productive when working from home than at an office or external workplace, according to a 2023 study out of the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.

Dejan Marjanovic via Getty Images Workers with disabilities appreciate working from home options because it reduces transportation and accessibility challenges they face going into the office.

Employees with flexible schedules tend to have better mental health.

Employees at workplaces that prioritize flexibility and higher job security are less likely to experience serious psychological distress or anxiety, according to a March 2024 study published in JAMA Network Open. The study, which polled more than 18,000 U.S. workers, defined “job flexibility” as the ability to adjust their own work schedule to meet personal demands.
